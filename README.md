Hmmm it seems create-react-app-typescript is deprecated since create-react-app has typescript support now.


## Setup
To setup the app and view it. You want to clone build and serve it.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muggy8/spair-test zhikaili
cd zhikaili
npm install
npm run build
node server```

Next you can visit your localhost to see the product. If you want to change the port you can call `node server` with `-d` or `-dev` to have it moved on port 5000 and you can also pass in a port using `--port=####`. Now you can visit the app via localhost in your browser
